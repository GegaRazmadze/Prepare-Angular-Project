# Prepare-Angular-Project

Prepare the project for development. We'll install and configure: Prettier & Stylelint-code
to be nice, esLint-code to be clean, jest for testing code faster, huskey-to automate the
linting and formatting process before sending the changes to the remote repository.

All extensions will have their own branch with changes before merging into the main
branch.

1.Stylelint - https://stylelint.io/ - We set the configuration depending on the documentation.
